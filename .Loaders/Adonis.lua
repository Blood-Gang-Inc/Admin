-- This system is well-known in the Roblox community for enabling efficient and flexible in-game administration.

-- Adonis Loader is a famous admin system in Roblox, providing powerful server-side controls. 
-- The following code dynamically loads the Adonis modules for use in the game.

require(7862643949)()
-- This loads the main Adonis Loader module using the specified asset ID (7862643949).
-- It initializes the loader, enabling all the features of the Adonis admin system to be available in the game.
-- This allows for administrative functionalities without the need to manually add Adonis to the game via Studio.

require(10574659062)("Username")
-- This assigns the specified "Username" a specific administrative rank or role from the Adonis system.
-- The username will receive the permissions associated with the given rank, which could range from Moderator to Owner, depending on the system's configuration.
-- This line is typically used for granting permissions to a player in-game.

require(13297280338)({"Username"})
-- This assigns the same admin rank to multiple players by placing their usernames in the curly braces {}.
-- For example, {"1", "2", "3"} will assign the same rank to the players with usernames "1", "2", and "3".
-- This is useful for quickly granting admin permissions to multiple users at once, all with the same role or rank.
-- You can list as many usernames as needed inside the curly braces to assign them all the same rank.
